Hello! I'm Matthew, a Software Engineer based in Austin, TX who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.

After graduating from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2013, I started my career working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and ended up a Software Engineer. How did that happen? While working at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base,FL, I took up a couple computer science course at Eastern Florida State College. Shortly after graduating with another degree from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), I co-founded and worked remotely at [Florida Disaster Rescue](https://www.floridadisasterrecue.org), where I was able to directly contribute towards aiding people in need when disaster strikes. Since then, I have worked at [Google](https://www.google.com), [IBM](https://www.IBM.com) , [Atlassian] (https://www.Atlassian.com) and now at [Amazon] (AWS). 

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
