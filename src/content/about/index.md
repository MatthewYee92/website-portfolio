Hello! I'm Matthew, an aerospace engineer turned software engineer based in Austin, TX who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.

After graduating from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2013, I started my career working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and ended up a software engineer. How did that happen? While working at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base,FL, I took up a couple computer science course at Eastern Florida State College. Shortly after graduating with another degree from [Eastern Florida State College](https://www.easternflorida.edu/), I joined the Software Engineering coding bootcamp at [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/). After graduating from the program, I worked remotely at [Florida Disaster Rescue](https://www.floridadisasterrecue.org), where I was able to directly contribute towards aiding people in need when disaster strikes. I recently worked at [Hack Reactor @ Galvanize](https://www.hackreactor.com) as a Software Engineering Instructor Resident, and I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. I presently work at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) as a software engineer on the cloud team, focusing on IBM cloudpaks and Waston AI.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
